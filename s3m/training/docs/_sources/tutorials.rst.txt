Tutorials
=========

These tutorials use Jupyter Lab which should already be installed if you have correctly performed the installation instructions.

If you do not already have a terminal open then do so now.

Navigate to the root *S3MPython_examples* directory.


Activate the environment.

.. code-block:: sh

  conda activate S3MPy


Now start the Jupyter Lab system with:


.. code-block:: sh

  jupyter lab


When the lab starts up the terminal will display something similar to:

.. image:: _static/lab_start.png


The lab will likely open in your default browser and the left side of the window will be similar to:

.. image:: _static/lab_01.png

From the filebrowser here, double click the *examples* directory. The view should now look like this:

.. image:: _static/lab_02.png

Double click on the **00. Getting Started.ipynb** filename and it will open in a new tab.

Follow the instructions.
