<h1>Glossary<a class="headerlink" href="#glossary" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>While many terms have more than one definition. The definitions presented here are in the context of managing data, especially in the S3Model context.</p>
<p id="abstract-model">An <strong>Abstract Model</strong> as defined in the field of software engineering and data modeling, an information model is usually an abstract, formal representation of entity types that may include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or occurrences, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system. Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations.</p>
<p id="ai">An area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence. Also, the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior.</p>
<p id="bdm"><strong>Business Decision Makers</strong> often come with titles like CEO, COO, CFO, etc. However, anyone with budget control authority can be considered a decision maker. For more information <a class="reference external" href="https://snov.io/glossary/decision-makers/">click here</a>.</p>
<p id="canonical-serialization">A <strong>Canonical Serialization</strong> is an instantiation of some information in a specific file format. Usually it is in a standardized format and adheres to a specification. The word canonical means it is considered the law for the subject at hand. In the context of S3Model, the XML Schema representing the reference model, means that any other implementation in any programming or data definition language must comply with the rules and constraints of the XML Schema implementation.</p>
<p id="compliance"><strong>Compliance</strong> is the practice of following regulations set forth by corporate governance, industry organizations, and governments. These regulations set forth protocols for how sensitive data is collected, used, stored, and managed, among other requirements.</p>
<p id="computable-models"><strong>Computable models</strong> in this context, are data models that can be used to validate data and insure data compliance based on the structure and rules contained within the data model.</p>
<p id="constraints">A <strong>constraint</strong> is simply <em>a limitation or restriction.</em> In the context of S3Model, constraints are mapped to the XML Schema constraint model. These constraints are sometimes referred to as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_facets.asp">restrictions or facets</a>.</p>
<p id="contextual"><strong>Contextual</strong> - Contextual means to view information as a whole- both the facts and where they came from.</p>
<p id="dm"><strong>DM</strong> short for Data Model in S3Model is defined as a set of constraints on the Reference Model. In the reference implementation this will be an XML Schema that imports the Refernce Model schema. In Python it is a Python file that imports the Python Reference Model.</p>
<p id="dm-id">The <strong>DM-ID</strong> is a unique identifier for each and every data model created in the S3Model ecosystem. No identifier can be duplicated because of the construction method. All identifiers in S3Model use a Collision Resistant Unique Identifier <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid">(CUID)</a>. Thouogh there are ports to virtually all programming languages, you can also get them <a class="reference external" href="https://www.getuniqueid.com/cuid">online here</a>.</p>
<p id="data-instance">A <strong>Data Instance</strong> is specific file or database entry that contains information based on some model. Examples include; an XML file, a JSON file, a row and its relations in a SQL database, a text file from an editor, or other concrete entity.</p>
<p id="data-modeling"><strong>Data Modeling</strong> - A data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.</p>
<p id="data-analyst"><strong>Data analysts</strong> use machine learning and AI tools to answer business questions.</p>
<p id="data-scientists"><strong>Data scientists</strong> typically spend more time modeling data and building analytic tools.</p>
<p id="domain-experts"><strong>Domain expert</strong> - A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavor. An accountant is an expert in the domain of accountancy, for example. The development of accounting software requires knowledge in two different domains, namely accounting and software.</p>
<p id="esperanto"><strong>Esperanto</strong> - an artificial language devised in 1887 as an international medium of communication, based on roots from the chief European languages. Majority of the speakers are found in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Brazil, United States, Poland, Italy, Germany and France. Surprisingly, there are also many Esperanto speakers in China and Japan. Dr. Zamenhof created the language to fight nationalism and boost internationalism and mutual understanding.</p>
<p id="graphdb">A <strong>graph database</strong> stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it. It must be noted that not having a pre-defined model has many drawbacks, lack of data validation being a major one. S3Model provides a mechanism to have a strong model and still store your data as a knowledge graph.</p>
<p id="json"><strong>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</strong> is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).</p>
<p id="linked-data"><strong>Linked Data</strong> lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, say collection of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/">Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases</a> are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of complexities.</p>
<p id="model-components"><strong>Model Components</strong> (MC) are defined as XML Schema <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_complextype.asp">complexTypes</a> in the reference implementation. Each one has a unique ID and once defined they are immutable. The are reusable across Data Models (<span class="xref std std-ref">DM</span>) in S3Model.</p>
<p id="ontologies"><strong>Ontologies</strong> - a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. One major advantage of using a domain ontology is its ability to define a semantic model of the data combined with the associated domain knowledge. Ontologies can also be used to define links between different types of semantic knowledge. Thus, ontologies can be used in formulating data analysis strategies.</p>
<p id="owl"><strong>OWL</strong> - The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things.</p>
<p id="pred-models"><strong>Predictive Models</strong> - Predictive modeling is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. In predictive modeling, data is collected, a statistical model is formulated, predictions are made, and the model is validated (or revised) as additional data becomes available.</p>
<p id="rdf"><strong>RDF</strong> - RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. Although frequently referred to as a <em>language</em>, RDF is mainly a data model. It is based on the idea that the things being described have properties, which have values, and that resources can be described by making statements. These statements consist of three components; a subject, a predicate, and an object. It should be noted that RDF is also a vocabulary that along with the RDFS vocabulary provides a set of terms that can be used for creating general/abstract descriptions of resources. OWL is a vocabulary built with RDF and RDFS vocabularies that provide new terms for creating more detailed descriptions of resources.</p>
<p id="rm">A <strong>Reference Model</strong> (RM) is an abstract framework or domain-specific ontology consisting of an interlinked set of clearly defined concepts produced by an expert or body of experts to encourage clear communication.</p>
<p id="s3model"><strong>S3Model</strong> is a modeling approach that includes a comprehensive reference model. Data Models are created by domain experts or other interested individuals that want to model some data. By creating this data model, the creator can be sure that when they send their data to a downstream user, such as an analyst, that user will have all of the computable, contextual information they need to understand the origin and meaning of the data.</p>
<p id="sem-int"><strong>Semantic Interoperability</strong> - Semantic interoperability denotes the ability of different applications and business partners to understand exchanged data in a similar way, implying a precise and unambiguous meaning of the exchanged information.</p>
<p id="semweb">The <strong>Semantic Web</strong> is a proposed development of the World Wide Web in which data in web pages is structured and tagged in such a way that it can be read directly by computers. The same technologies may be applied to any data. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">The W3C website has more details</a>.</p>
<p id="sqldb"><strong>SQL databases</strong> <em>SQL</em> stands for Structured Query Language. Itâs used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data.</p>
<p id="upper-ontology">An <strong>upper ontology</strong> (also known as a top-level ontology, upper model, or foundation ontology) is an ontology (in the sense used in information science) which consists of very general terms (such as âobjectâ, âpropertyâ, ârelationâ) that are common across all domains. An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.</p>
<p id="validation"><strong>Validation</strong> means checking the accuracy and quality of source data before using, importing or otherwise processing data. Different types of validation can be performed depending on destination constraints or objectives. For example, you could use data validation to make sure a value is a number between 1 and 6, make sure a date occurs in the next 30 days, or make sure a text entry is less than 25 characters.</p>
<p id="validation-chain">A <strong>validation chain</strong> is a series of complimentary components that serve to perform <a class="reference internal" href="#validation"><span class="std std-ref">validation</span></a></p>
<p id="xml"><strong>XML</strong> stands for extensible markup language. A markup language is a set of codes, or tags, that describes the text in a digital document. â¦ XML, a more flexible cousin of HTML, makes it possible to conduct complex business over the Internet.</p>
<p id="xmldb">An XML database is a database that stores data in XML format. This type of database is suited for businesses with data in XML format and for situations where XML storage is a practical way to archive data, metadata and other digital resources.</p>
