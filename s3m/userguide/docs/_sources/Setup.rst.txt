Tutorial Setup
==============

* You **MUST** know how to find a terminal window on your computer.
* You **MUST** understand how to use a *ZIP* file extractor.
* You **MUST** know how to navigate directories/folders in your terminal.

*If you do not know how to do these things there are tutorials available for all operating systems on the Internet.*

.. note::

    We **RECOMMEND** opening external links from this page in a new tab on your browser. That way you can look for the S3M logo and return here to continue the tutorial steps.

Prerequisites
-------------

To learn about the S3Model Reference Model using the Jupyter notebook exercises, the user will first need to install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_ for their operating system. Be sure to use the version for **Python 3.7 or later**. Unless the user is an expert Python developer and can install the prerequisites manually, Anaconda is by far the best way to install the basic prerequisites for this tutorial. When installing Anaconda, the non-expert user should allow Anaconda to set the system Python interpreter during installation. 

Open a terminal window: 

* On Windows, use an Anaconda Prompt terminal from the Anaconda menu. 
* On Mac or Linux, use a terminal window. `Detailed instructions <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-navigator>`_. 

In the terminal window the prompt should start with **(base)**. Indicating that Anaconda has set the  Python environment.

Install `Jupyterlab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html>`_  interface::

    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

Navigate to a convienent directory in the terminal, for installing the tutorial.

.. warning::

    **REMEMBER** this directory/folder. We certainly don't recommend putting these files in the root directory. If you can't think of a better place then do this in the *Documents* folder. 

Using the terminal window create a new subdirectory named, "S3MTraining"::

    mkdir S3MTraining

Change to the new directory::

    cd S3MTraining

Issue this command in the terminal window::

    conda create -n S3MTraining jupyterlab


You will see a long list of *packages* to  be installed. A prompt will ask you to confirm installation. Respond with a *y* and then the *Enter* key.

The above command creates a `conda environment <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html>`_ named **S3MTraining**. 

Activate the environment::

    conda activate S3MTraining   


Install the `S3Model Python <https://pypi.org/manage/project/S3MPython/releases/>`_ implementation with this command::

    pip install S3MPython

When the installation is complete, the last line in the terminal should be:

    **Successfully installed S3MPython-(version number) and a list of the other packages installed.**

S3MPython needs to be configured for any project. This includes using it with theese examples.
In the terminal window, type::

    python
    >>>from S3MPython import project
    >>>project.init()

Test the installation by starting the Jupyter Lab server::

    jupyter-lab

This command should open a new tab in your default web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.)

Get the examples
----------------

In a new browser tab, go to the `Github repository <https://github.com/twcook/S3M_Python_Training_examples>`_ to download the examples.

Click on the green *Code* button on the right side of the page.

.. image:: _static/green_code.png

A dropdown menu will appear.

.. image:: _static/download_zip.png

Select the *Download Zip* link. Download this file to the *S3MTraining* directory.

Using your ZIP file extractor of choice:

* Open the *S3M_Python_Training_examples* folder in the ZIP extractor.
* Extract the files and folders into the *S3MTraining* folder created earlier.

The *S3MTraining* folder should look similar to:

.. image:: _static/extracted.png


Testing the installation
------------------------

In the original Jupyter Notebook browser tab: 

.. image:: _static/Jupyter_home.png

Create a new notebook by clicking on the *New* button on the right side of the window. 

A menu will dropdown as shown here:

.. image:: _static/Jupyter_New_Notebook.png

From the menu select the *Python 3* option. This should open a new tab in your browser and the page should look like this:

.. image:: _static/Jupyter_New_Tab.png

and enter the following code into the first cell::

 from S3MPython.dm import DMType

 help(DMType)

It should look like this:

.. image:: _static/First_Cell.png

Now click on the *Run* button in the menu.

If all went well your window should have this display:

.. image:: _static/After_Run.png

The elements and descriptions for the Data Model (DM) wrapper will be displayed as shown above. Each model component has a help file that you can display in the same way. 

**Close this browser tab.** If you get a Warning that your changes won't be saved. Just click the *Leave* button.


Jupyter notebook examples
-------------------------


* select the *examples* folder. If you do not see the folder. There is a *Refresh* button next to the *New* button that you used earlier.

* in the *examples* folder, select the *00. Getting Started.ipynb* file. 

.. image:: _static/tutorial_start.png

Follow all instructions. 


**Congratulations!**

The user is now ready to explore the lessons using Jupyter notebooks, where the user will interactively learn how to build data models using the **S3Model** approach.

.. note::

    In case you accidentally close the terminal where you started the Jupyter server. You can resart it by:
    
     * Open a new terminal.
     * Navigate to the *S3MTraining* directory. 
     * Activate the environment with the command: *conda activate S3MTraining*
     * Start Jupyter with the command: *jupyter notebook*.

**If you want to remove the S3MTraining environment** use these commands::
    
    conda deactivate
    conda remove --name S3MTraining --all
