<section id="abstract-model">
<h2>Abstract Model<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An <em>Abstract Model</em> as defined in the field of software engineering and data modeling, an information model is usually an abstract, formal representation of entity types that may include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or occurrences, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system. Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations.</p>

<section id="canonical-serialization">
<h2>Canonical Serialization<a class="headerlink" href="#canonical-serialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <em>Canonical Serialization</em> is an instantiation of some information in a specific file format. Usually it is in a standardized format and adheres to a specification. The word canonical means it is considered the law for the subject at hand. In the context of S3Model, the XML Schema representing the reference model, means that any other implementation in any programming or data definition language must comply with the rules and constraints of the XML Schema implementation.</p>
</section>
<section id="compliance">
<h2>Compliance<a class="headerlink" href="#compliance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Compliance</em> is the practice of following regulations set forth by corporate governance, industry organizations, and governments. These regulations set forth protocols for how sensitive data is collected, used, stored, and managed, among other requirements.</p>
</section>
<section id="computable-models">
<h2>Computable models<a class="headerlink" href="#computable-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Computable models</em> in this context, are data models that can be used to validate data and insure data compliance based on the structure and rules contained within the data model.</p>
</section>
<section id="constraint">
<h2>Constraint<a class="headerlink" href="#constraint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <em>constraint</em> is simply <em>a limitation or restriction.</em> In the context of S3Model, constraints are mapped to the XML Schema constraint model.

<h2>Collision-Resistant Unique Identifier (MCUID)<a class="headerlink" href="#collision-resistant-unique-identifier-mcuid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid">CUID</a> as used in S3Model provides a globally unique identifier for each model component and each data model.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-model-dm">
<h2>Data Model (DM)<a class="headerlink" href="#data-model-dm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This component is a domain concept data model that is created by expressing constraints on a generic reference model. In the S3Model reference implementation eco-system, these constraints are formed through the use of the XML Schema complexTypes using the <em>restriction element</em> with its <em>base attribute</em> set to the appropriate RM complexType. DMs are immutable, once published they are never edited because once data is released in conformance with a DM, this is where the sharable semantics are located.</p>
<p>DMs are uniquely identified by the prefix ‘dm-’ followed by a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid">CUID</a>. They are valid against one version of the S3Model Reference Model XML Schema identified by the <em>import</em> element in the header. <strong>This design gives them temporal durability and prevents the requirement ever to migrate instance data.</strong> The result of this approach is that all data, for all time , in all contexts, can be <em>maintained with complete syntactic integrity and full semantics</em>. The semantics for a concept modeled as a DM is represented using Semantic Web technologies. The DM identifier is the subject in each of the <em>Subject, Predicate, Object</em> RDF statements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the reference implementation this will be an XML Schema that imports the Refernce Model schema.</p></li>
<li><p>In Python it is a Python file that imports the Python Reference Model.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="data-model-id">
<h2>Data Model ID<a class="headerlink" href="#data-model-id" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The data model ID is a unique identifier for each and every data model created in the S3Model ecosystem. No identifier can be duplicated because of the construction method. All identifiers in S3Model uses a Collision Resistant Unique Identifier <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid">(CUID)</a> preceeded by the characters <em>dm-</em>.</p>

<section id="graph-database">
<h2>Graph Database<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <em>graph database*</em> stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it. It must be noted that not having a pre-defined model has many drawbacks, lack of data validation being a major one. S3Model provides a mechanism to have a strong model and still store your data as a knowledge graph.</p>

<section id="javascript-object-notation-json">
<h2>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)<a class="headerlink" href="#javascript-object-notation-json" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>JSON</em> is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).</p>
</section>
<section id="linked-data">
<h2>Linked Data<a class="headerlink" href="#linked-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Linked Data</em> lies at the heart of what the Semantic Web (Web 2.0) is all about: large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, say collection of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/">Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases</a> are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of complexities.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-component-mc">
<h2>Model Component (MC)<a class="headerlink" href="#model-component-mc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The name comes from the fact that it is a complete XML Schema complexType that represents a simple concept and that it can be reused in any DM. This reuse is due to the use of CUIDs for the complexType name attribute. Since complexType names must begin with an alphabetic character, all S3Model RMC names start with the prefix ‘mc-’ followed by the CUID. This naming convention facilitates the association with public element names in instances since they reuse the CUID but have a prefix of ‘ms-’ (Model Symbol) in place of the ‘mc-.’ The use of a CUID allows the constraint on a reference model type to be reused many times in a DM with different parameters such as enumeration constraints. The semantics for a concept modeled as an MC is represented using Semantic Web technologies. The MC name is the subject in each of the <em>Subject, Predicate, Object</em> RDF statements.</p>

<section id="multi-level-healthcare-information-modeling-mlhim">
<h2>Multi-Level Healthcare Information Modeling (MLHIM)<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-level-healthcare-information-modeling-mlhim" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The academic MLHIM project was hosted at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.uerj.br/">Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)</a>. The initial multi-level concepts were based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://specifications.openehr.org/">openEHR specifications</a>. The project members addressed many of the short-comings in openEHR during the interations of MLHIM. However, MLHIM like openEHR was healthcare domain specific. Once the MLHIM project ended, a few members took the successes and developed S3Model as a domain independent solution to semantic interoperability.</p>

<section id="ontology">
<h2>Ontology<a class="headerlink" href="#ontology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An <em>Ontology</em> is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. One major advantage of using a domain ontology is its ability to define a semantic model of the data combined with the associated domain knowledge. Ontologies can also be used to define links between different types of semantic knowledge. Thus, ontologies can be used in formulating data analysis strategies.</p>

<h2>Predictive Model<a class="headerlink" href="#predictive-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Predictive modeling is a commonly used statistical technique to predict future behavior. In predictive modeling, data is collected, a statistical model is formulated, predictions are made, and the model is validated (or revised) as additional data becomes available.</p>
</section>
<section id="resource-description-framework-rdf">
<h2>Resource Description Framework (RDF)<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-description-framework-rdf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>RDF</em> is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. Although frequently referred to as a <em>language</em>, RDF is mainly a data model. It is based on the idea that the things being described have properties, which have values, and that resources can be described by making statements. These statements consist of three components; a subject, a predicate, and an object. It should be noted that RDF is also a vocabulary that along with the RDFS vocabulary provides a set of terms that can be used for creating general/abstract descriptions of resources. OWL is a vocabulary built with RDF and RDFS vocabularies that provide new terms for creating more detailed descriptions of resources.</p>
</section>
<section id="reference-model-rm">
<h2>Reference Model (RM)<a class="headerlink" href="#reference-model-rm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <em>RM</em> is a small set of structurally oriented concept definitions that allow for building arbitrarily complex models without introducing domain semantics into the structure. Domain concepts are modeled as <em>restrictions</em> on these RM concepts. The RM, therefore, defines a standard set of ideas that allow for query and knowledge discovery across data without prior knowledge of the actual content.</p>

<section id="shareable-structured-semantic-model-s3model">
<h2>Shareable-Structured-Semantic Model (S3Model)<a class="headerlink" href="#shareable-structured-semantic-model-s3model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Shareable-Structured-Semantic Model (S3Model)</em> is an open source/open content project with the goal of solving the cross-domain information, semantic interoperability problem.</p>
<p>It uses a multi-level information modeling approach in combination with widely available tools and language infrastructure to allow the exchange of the syntactic and semantic information along with data.</p>
<p>S3Model is a modeling approach that includes a comprehensive reference model. Data Models are created by domain experts or other interested individuals that want to model some data. By creating this data model, the creator can be sure that when they send their data to a downstream user, such as an analyst, that user will have all of the computable, contextual information they need to understand the origin and meaning of the data.</p>

<h2>Upper Ontology<a class="headerlink" href="#upper-ontology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An <strong>upper ontology</strong> (also known as a top-level ontology, upper model, or foundation ontology) is an ontology (in the sense used in information science) which consists of very general terms (such as “object”, “property”, “relation”) that are common across all domains. An important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain-specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions. Terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology, e.g., the upper ontology classes are superclasses or supersets of all the classes in the domain ontologies.</p>
