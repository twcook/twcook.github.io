Specifications & Reference Implementation
------------------------------------------

The S3Model project has been developed by Data Insights, Inc. based on years of research and development in semantic interoperability in healthcare IT.

This solution has been **generalized for any domain** and can now be used as the reference information model for a linked data, model first approach to provide a foundation for structured, data driven models.

The specifications and reference model implementation are controlled and licensed by Data Insights, Inc.

An open contribution and governance solution is being designed as interested parties apply. It is expected to be composed of a board of individuals knowledgeable about S3Model concepts and they will have full control over changes to the specifications and the reference implementation.
