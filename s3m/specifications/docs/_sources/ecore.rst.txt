=============
Eclipse Ecore
=============

There is now an Eclipse Ecore model included in the documentation.
If people find this technology useful, then please expand on it. I have minimal experience with Eclipse.

I could use some help making this more useful.  Maybe you can even generate a Java code base from it? Perhaps you can edit DM models in it? Maybe you can generate Python code?  I have no idea ...

Everything should be there.

If you can help with using this Ecore model to 'do something' then please let me know.
