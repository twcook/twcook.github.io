============

The *Shareable, Structured, Semantic Model* (S3Model or S3M) specifications are based on more than ten years of research and development on computable, semantic interoperability. 

**S3Model is the foundation for your modern linked data information management systems**. 

The S3Model approach allows domain experts to build the data model they need for their application and the shared models are the basis for a model-driven, linked data information management strategy. This sharable information model allows any data consumer to determine if the data is correct for their needs without imposing requirements on the data capture process.

The above paragraph describes the foundation of *model-driven, computable, semantic interoperability* in S3Model implementations. To be successful with implementing and creating systems with the full value of S3Model based applications it is essential to understand the core concepts as laid out in the :doc:`Modeling Concepts <./modeling_concepts>` document. 

It is essential to keep in mind that data modeling is your first step in data governance. If you do not know what you have, you cannot possibly manage it nor use it for maximum effect. Data modeling has gotten a bad name because of inflexible approaches. However, SQL is not *data modeling*; it is an implementation strategy. 

A **data first** strategy based on thoughtful modeling for reuse in the future means more long-term value for your efforts.

In today's world where data warehouses and data marts are too slow and rigid and data lakes too permissive and messy; S3Model is the Goldilocks solution. It is just right. S3Model provides the ability to model, semantically, the data you know you need in a manner that can be useful in the future.  You will then know how and where it came from and be able to machine process it instead of manually cleaning and re-purposing something of dubious quality.
